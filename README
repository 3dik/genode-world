          ==========================================================
          A collection of community-maintained components for Genode
          ==========================================================


This repository hosts Genode components that do not fall in the narrow scope of
the Genode OS Framework (http://genode.org), e.g., ported applications,
libraries, and games.

To use it, you first need to obtain a clone of Genode:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git genode

Now, clone the _genode-world.git_ repository to _genode/repos/world_:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-world.git genode/repos/world

By placing the _world_ repository under the _repos/_ directory, Genode's tools
will automatically incorporate the ports provided by the _world_ repository.

For building software of the _world_ repository, the build-directory
configuration _etc/build.conf_ must be extended with the following line:

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/world


Note of caution
---------------

In contrast to the components found in the mainline Genode repository, the
components within the _world_ repository are not subjected to the regular
quality-assurance measures of Genode Labs. Hence, problems are to be expected.
If you encounter bugs, build problems, or stability issues, please report them
to the issue tracker [1] or the Genode mailing list [2].
