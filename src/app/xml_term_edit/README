This component is a simple terminal frontend to _xml_editor_.

The _add_ command opens and reads a file path passed as an agument
and submits it to _xml_editor_ for inclusion into the file being
edited.

The _del_ command does the same, but submits a _remove_ edit action
and _xml_editor_ will remove nodes from the file being edited using
the XML node type and _name_ attribute.

See _run/xml_term_edit.run_ for an example.
