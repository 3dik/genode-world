This component serves ROM requests, loading each from TFTP.
Only a subset of RFC1350 is implemented, so the maximum transfer size is 32MB.

The IP stack configuration is handled by DHCP by default,
see the libc_lwip_nic_dhcp library for details.

The rest of the configuration is parsed from policies, the options are:

 ip      - server IP address, required
 port    - sever port
 dir     - root requests into this server-side directory
 timeout - session will timeout if forward progress is not made for this period of time

Example:
	<policy label_prefix="init" ip="10.0.2.2" port="69" dir="/genode" timeout="10"/>

WARNING: The TFTP protocol has no security assurance whatsoever,
use an authenticated tunnel whenever possible!
